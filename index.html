            What Is Cryptocurrency?
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Cryptocurrency — crypto for short — is digital currency that
            employs cryptography and encryption to secure and validate its
            transactions. Because they exist in a decentralized system,
            cryptocurrencies don’t have one central entity like a bank to
            verify transactions or issue new units. Instead, they rely on a
            peer-to-peer system, meaning anyone anywhere can send and receive
            payments securely.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            The first cryptocurrency to come on the market was Bitcoin, which
            was launched in 2009 by a cryptographer working under the
            pseudonym of “Satoshi Nakamoto.” Today, there are thousands of
            cryptocurrencies out there, but Bitcoin remains the most popular.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-[21px] font-semibold pt-5 pb-3">
            How Does Cryptocurrency Work?
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Like any other currency, cryptocurrency can be used to buy
            everyday things, from food to cars. But unlike cash,
            cryptocurrency payments exist solely online as digital entries in
            a database describing specific transactions, otherwise known as a
            ledger. This is made possible by blockchain technology — a
            digital, decentralized ledger that is composed of encrypted blocks
            of data, which are “chained” together and secured (often by using
            complex math problems).
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            New units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called
            mining, which involves using computer power to solve complicated
            mathematical problems that generate coins.

            Types of Cryptocurrencies
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Generally, there are four types of cryptocurrencies one should
            know about before they dive into this space: altcoins, privacy
            coins, stablecoins and tokens.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Altcoins are any cryptocurrency that isn’t Bitcoin — the original
            cryptocurrency. Namecoin is widely considered to be the first
            altcoin, and it prefaced the concept of Colored Coins, a crypto
            asset marked to represent real-world assets. These became the
            basis for NFTs. And now, thanks to the open-source nature of
            blockchain technology, altcoins (as well as their respective
            platforms) can be created by anyone with access to the internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Privacy coins are not accepted everywhere. Some cryptocurrency
            exchanges won’t allow the sale or trade of privacy coins on their
            platforms because they could potentially be used for nefarious
            purposes. And countries like South Korea, Japan and Australia have
            even banned them.

            How Many Cryptocurrencies Are There?
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Again, there are thousands of cryptocurrencies out there today,
            with estimates ranging from 12,000 to 19,000. At the end of 2021,
            the market was reportedly adding about 1,000 new cryptocurrencies
            every month.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            This exponential growth is largely due to the fact that there are
            virtually no barriers to entry when it comes to blockchain
            innovation. Anyone who wants to create a cryptocurrency can do it,
            even if they have little-to-no tech experience.

          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Cryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to
            verify transactions. This means advanced coding is involved in
            storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and
            to public ledgers. The aim of encryption is to provide security
            and safety.

            When it was first launched, Bitcoin was intended to be a medium

            a cup of coffee to a computer or even big-ticket items like real
            estate. That hasn’t quite materialized and, while the number of
            institutions accepting cryptocurrencies is growing, large
            transactions involving it are rare. Even so, it is possible to buy
            a wide variety of products from e-commerce websites using crypto.
            Here are some examples:
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Several companies that sell tech products accept crypto on their
            websites, such as newegg.com, AT&T, and Microsoft. Overstock, an
            e-commerce platform, was among the first sites to accept Bitcoin.
            Shopify, Rakuten, and Home Depot also accept it.

                    into the world. But, in reality, this technology dates all
                    the way back to the 1980s, when the first decentralized
                    digital currency was conceived of. Here’s a quick overview
                    of some of the most important moments in cryptocurrency’s
                    decades-long history.

            The Many Uses of Cryptocurrency
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-3">
            No matter how you come to own cryptocurrency, once you have it in
            your possession there are lots of ways to use it. Most people
            think of cryptocurrency as a high-risk investment opportunity for
            young millenials and tech bros, but this space is so much more
            than that. Here are three interesting ways cryptocurrency is being
            put to use right now.

            1. Getting Paid to Play Games
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-3">
            After years of experiencing massive success in their own
            respective corners of the internet, the gaming and cryptocurrency
            sectors have come together to create a whole new segment known as
            GameFi.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            A portmanteau of “game” and “finance,” GameFi refers to
            blockchain-based games that let players earn in-game rewards with
            real-world value by completing tasks, battling other players and
            progressing through various game levels. These rewards come in the
            form of assets like crypto tokens, virtual land, and NFTs like
            avatars and weapons. Thanks to the decentralized nature of these
            games, players can buy, transfer and sell these assets outside the
            four corners of the game’s virtual world in exchange for real
            money.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-[21px] font-semibold pt-5 pb-3">
            2. Investing in Early Stage Startups
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Traditionally, venture capitalism is reserved for the wealthy few.
            Massive firms like Intel Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Tiger
            Global make up the majority of the startup funding activity in the
            United States, and are worth billions of dollars.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            But, a small piece of the venture capital pie is beginning to be
            eaten up by individuals, thanks to the emergence of digital,
            token-based fundraising. These days, anyone with access to the
            internet and some crypto to blow can become an investor in an
            early-stage startup, providing them with some much-needed seed
            capital to get their idea off the ground.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-[21px] font-semibold pt-5 pb-3">
            3. Storing (and Growing) Wealth
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-3">
            While you certainly don’t imagine that your bank account and
            assets will be frozen, the truth is that it happens more often
            than you might think. All it takes is for someone to be accused of
            financial misconduct, and their access to cash can be completely
            cut off by the government or banks — even if they’ve done nothing
            wrong. Moreover, banks can not only freeze people’s accounts
            without their consent, but they are also vulnerable to hacks,
            thefts and various other malpractices.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Unlike cash, decentralized digital money like cryptocurrency
            behave like a secured store of wealth outside of a traditional
            bank. And that store is censorship-resistant, meaning only
            authorized people with private keys can access the wallets. Hence,
            no personal crypto wallet can be accessed by a third party — be it
            banker or hacker.
